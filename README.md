# GPX Tagging for FOV videos

Simple tool to add a GPX overlay to videos shot
with a FOV camera like GoPro or insta360.

## Getting started
The tool requires Python3 to be installed, e.g. from
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3920/)

Then run 
```
./editor
```
from a terminal. This is a very simple script that ensures
that python3 is installed, installs dependencies, starts
a local web server and opens a web browser. These steps
can be tweaked on different platforms and for more
advanced users.

## Working with the tool
The tool requires a GPX file that was used when the video was shot.
The file can for instance be exported from all
activites, settings in the Garmin Connect Web interface.
The video does not have to be uploaded but you may want to transfer
it over USB so the camera does not need to be connected while editing.
