# GPX Tagging for FOV videos
Simple tool to add a GPX overlay to videos shot
with a FOV camera like GoPro or insta360.

## Starting the editor
Simply open [index.html](index.html) in a browser or
run it from the [GitHub pages of this repo](https://patompa.github.io/gpxtagger/).

## Working with the tool
The tool requires a GPX file that was used when the video was shot.
The file can for instance be exported from all
activites, settings in the Garmin Connect Web interface.
The video does not have to be uploaded but you may want to transfer
it over USB so the camera does not need to be connected while editing.
